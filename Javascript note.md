# 30 Days of Javascript

To write our first JavaScript code, we used a built-in function **console.log()**. We passed an argument as input data, and the function displays the output. We passed `'Hello, World'` as input data or argument in the console.log() function.

The **`console.log()`** function can take multiple parameters separated by commas. The syntax looks like as follows:**`console.log(param1, param2, param3)`**

`console.log('Hello, World!')`

Out put: `Hello, World!`

### Comments

Comments are very important to make code more readable and to leave remarks in our code. JavaScript does not execute the comment part of our code. In JavaScript, any text line starting with // in JavaScript is a comment, and anything enclosed like this `//` is also a comment.

**Example: Single Line Comment**

```
// This is the first comment
// This is the second comment
// I am a single line comment
```

**Example: Multiline Comment**

```
/*
This is a multiline comment
 Multiline comments can take multiple lines
 JavaScript is the language of the web
 */
```

### Syntax

Programming languages are similar to human languages. English or many other language uses words, phrases, sentences, compound sentences and other more to convey a meaningful message. The English meaning of syntax is *the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language*. The technical definition of syntax is the structure of statements in a computer language. Programming languages have syntax. JavaScript is a programming language and like other programming languages it has its own syntax. If we do not write a syntax that JavaScript understands, it will raise different types of errors. We will explore different kinds of JavaScript errors later. For now, let us see syntax errors.

### Code Editor

We can write our codes on the browser console, but it won't be for bigger projects. In a real working environment, developers use different code editors to write their codes. In this 30 days of JavaScript challenge, we will be using Visual Studio Code. Try to interact with the labeled icons.

## Adding JavaScript to a Web Page

JavaScript can be added to a web page in three different ways:

- ***Inline script***
- ***Internal script***
- ***External script***
- ***Multiple External scripts***

### Inline Script

Create a project folder on your desktop or in any location, name it 30DaysOfJS and create an ***`index.html`*** file in the project folder. Then paste the following code and open it in a browser, for example [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

`<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfScript:Inline Script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button onclick="alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript!')">Click Me</button>
  </body>
</html>`

### Internal Script

The internal script can be written in the *`head`* or the *`body`*, but it is preferred to put it on the body of the HTML document. First, let us write on the head part of the page.

`<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfScript:Internal Script</title>
    <script>
      console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>`

### External Script

Similar to the internal script, the external script link can be on the header or body, but it is preferred to put it in the body. First, we should create an external JavaScript file with .js extension. All files ending with .js extension are JavaScript files. Create a file named introduction.js inside your project directory and write the following code and link this .js file at the bottom of the body.

`console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')`

External scripts in the *body*:

```
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfJavaScript:External script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- JavaScript external link could be in the header or in the body -->
    <!-- Before the closing tag of the body is the recommended place to put the external JavaScript script -->
    <script src="introduction.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open the browser console to see the output of the `console.log()`.

### Multiple External Scripts

We can also link multiple external JavaScript files to a web page. Create a `helloworld.js` file inside the 30DaysOfJS folder and write the following code.

```

```

`<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Multiple External Scripts</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="./helloworld.js"></script>
    <script src="./introduction.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>`

## Introduction to Data types

In JavaScript and also other programming languages, there are different types of data types. The following are JavaScript primitive data types: *String, Number, Boolean, undefined, Null*, and *Symbol*.

### Numbers

- Integers: Integer (negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...
- Float-point numbers: Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ...

### Strings

A collection of one or more characters between two single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.

Examples:`'a'`,`'Asabeneh`,`'JavaScript is a beautiful programming language'`

### Booleans

A boolean value is either True or False. Any comparisons returns a boolean value, which is either true or false.

A boolean data type is either a true or false value.

**Example:**

`true 
false`

### Undefined

In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In addition to that, if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined.

`let firstName
console.log(firstName)`

### Null

Null in JavaScript means an empty value.

`let emptyValue = null`

## Checking Data Types

To check the data type of a certain variable, we use the **typeof** operator. See the following example.

`console.log(typeof 'Asabeneh') // string
console.log(typeof 5) // number
console.log(typeof true) // boolean
console.log(typeof null) // object type
console.log(typeof undefined) // undefined`

## Variables

Variables are *containers* of data. Variables are used to *store* data in a memory location. When a variable is declared, a memory location is reserved. When a variable is assigned to a value (data), the memory space will be filled with that data. To declare a variable, we use *var*, *let*, or *const* keywords.

For a variable that changes at a different time, we use *let*. If the data does not change at all, we use *const*. For example, PI, country name, gravity do not change, and we can use *const*. We will not use var in this challenge and I don't recommend you to use it. It is error prone way of declaring variable it has lots of leak. We will talk more about var, let, and const in detail in other sections (scope). For now, the above explanation is enough.

A valid JavaScript variable name must follow the following rules:

- A JavaScript variable name should not begin with a number.
- A JavaScript variable name does not allow special characters except dollar sign and underscore.
- A JavaScript variable name follows a camelCase convention.
- A JavaScript variable name should not have space between words.

The following are examples of valid JavaScript variables.

```
firstName
lastName
country
city
capitalCity
age
isMarried

first_name
last_name
is_married
capital_city

num1
num_1
_num_1
$num1
year2020
year_2020
```

The first and second variables on the list follows the camelCase convention of declaring in JavaScript. In this material, we will use camelCase variables(camelWithOneHump). We use CamelCase(CamelWithTwoHump) to declare classes, we will discuss about classes and objects in other section.

Example of invalid variables:

```
  first-name
  1_num
  num_#_1
```

Let us declare variables with different data types. To declare a variable, we need to use *let* or *const* keyword before the variable name. Following the variable name, we write an equal sign (assignment operator), and a value(assigned data).

The nameOfVriable is the name that stores different data of value. See below for detail examples.

**Examples of declared variables**

```
// Declaring different variables of different data types
let firstName = 'Asabeneh' // first name of a person
let lastName = 'Yetayeh' // last name of a person
let country = 'Finland' // country
let city = 'Helsinki' // capital city
let age = 100 // age in years
let isMarried = true

console.log(firstName, lastName, country, city, age, isMarried)
```

```
Asabeneh Yetayeh Finland Helsinki 100 true
```

```
// Declaring variables with number values
let age = 100 // age in years
const gravity = 9.81 // earth gravity  in m/s2
const boilingPoint = 100 // water boiling point, temperature in °C
const PI = 3.14 // geometrical constant
console.log(gravity, boilingPoint, PI)
```

```
9.81 100 3.14
```

`// Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma, however I recommend to use a seperate line to make code more readble
let name = 'Asabeneh', job = 'teacher', live = 'Finland'
console.log(name, job, live)`

## Data Types

In the previous section, we mentioned a little bit about data types. Data or values have data types. Data types describe the characteristics of data. Data types can be divided into two:

1. Primitive data types
2. Non-primitive data types(Object References)

### Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types in JavaScript include:

1. Numbers - Integers, floats
2. Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote
3. Booleans - true or false value

Non-primitive data types in JavaScript includes:

1. Objects
2. Arrays

Now, let us see what exactly primitive and non-primitive data types mean. *Primitive* data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it.

**Example:**

`let word = 'JavaScript'`

If we try to modify the string stored in variable *word*, JavaScript should raise an error. Any data type under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote is a string data type.

`word[0] = 'Y'`

### Non-Primitive Data Types

*Non-primitive* data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created. Let us see by creating an array. An array is a list of data values in a square bracket. Arrays can contain the same or different data types. Array values are referenced by their index. In JavaScript array index starts at zero. I.e., the first element of an array is found at index zero, the second element at index one, and the third element at index two, etc.

```
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums[0] = 10

console.log(nums)  // [10, 2, 3]
```

As you can see, an array, which is a non-primitive data type is mutable. Non-primitive data types cannot be compared by value. Even if two non-primitive data types have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal.

```
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]

console.log(nums == numbers)  // false

let userOne = {
name:'Asabeneh',
role:'teaching',
country:'Finland'
}

let userTwo = {
name:'Asabeneh',
role:'teaching',
country:'Finland'
}

console.log(userOne == userTwo) // false
```

Rule of thumb, we do not compare non-primitive data types. Do not compare arrays, functions, or objects. Non-primitive values are referred to as reference types, because they are being compared by reference instead of value. Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object.

```
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
let numbers = nums

console.log(nums == numbers)  // true

let userOne = {
name:'Asabeneh',
role:'teaching',
country:'Finland'
}

let userTwo = userOne

console.log(userOne == userTwo)  // true
```

If you have a hard time understanding the difference between primitive data types and non-primitive data types, you are not the only one. Calm down and just go to the next section and try to come back after some time. Now let us start the data types by number type.

## Numbers

Numbers are integers and decimal values which can do all the arithmetic operations. Let's see some examples of Numbers.

### Declaring Number Data Types

```
let age = 35
const gravity = 9.81  // we use const for non-changing values, gravitational constant in  m/s2
let mass = 72         // mass in Kilogram
const PI = 3.14       // pi a geometrical constant

// More Examples
const boilingPoint = 100 // temperature in oC, boiling point of water which is a constant
const bodyTemp = 37      // oC average human body temperature, which is a constant

console.log(age, gravity, mass, PI, boilingPoint, bodyTemp)
```

### Math Object

In JavaScript the Math Object provides a lots of methods to work with numbers.

```
const PI = Math.PI

console.log(PI)                            // 3.141592653589793

// Rounding to the closest number
// if above .5 up if less 0.5 down rounding

console.log(Math.round(PI))                // 3 to round values to the nearest number

console.log(Math.round(9.81))              // 10

console.log(Math.floor(PI))                // 3 rounding down

console.log(Math.ceil(PI))                 // 4 rounding up

console.log(Math.min(-5, 3, 20, 4, 5, 10)) // -5, returns the minimum value

console.log(Math.max(-5, 3, 20, 4, 5, 10)) // 20, returns the maximum value

const randNum = Math.random() // creates random number between 0 to 0.999999
console.log(randNum)

// Let us  create random number between 0 to 10

const num = Math.floor(Math.random () * 11) // creates random number between 0 and 10
console.log(num)

//Absolute value
console.log(Math.abs(-10))      // 10

//Square root
console.log(Math.sqrt(100))     // 10

console.log(Math.sqrt(2))       // 1.4142135623730951

// Power
console.log(Math.pow(3, 2))     // 9

console.log(Math.E)             // 2.718

// Logarithm
// Returns the natural logarithm with base E of x, Math.log(x)
console.log(Math.log(2))        // 0.6931471805599453
console.log(Math.log(10))       // 2.302585092994046

// Returns the natural logarithm of 2 and 10 respectively
console.log(Math.LN2)           // 0.6931471805599453
console.log(Math.LN10)          // 2.302585092994046

// Trigonometry
Math.sin(0)
Math.sin(60)

Math.cos(0)
Math.cos(60)
```

### Random Number Generator

The JavaScript Math Object has a random() method number generator which generates number from 0 to 0.999999999...

```
let randomNum = Math.random() // generates 0 to 0.999...
```

Now, let us see how we can use random() method to generate a random number between 0 and 10:

```
let randomNum = Math.random()         // generates 0 to 0.999
let numBtnZeroAndTen = randomNum * 11

console.log(numBtnZeroAndTen)         // this gives: min 0 and max 10.99

let randomNumRoundToFloor = Math.floor(numBtnZeroAndTen)
console.log(randomNumRoundToFloor)    // this gives between 0 and 10
```

## Strings

Strings are texts, which are under ***single*** , ***double***, ***back-tick*** quote. To declare a string, we need a variable name, assignment operator, a value under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote. Let's see some examples of strings:

```
let space = ' '           // an empty space string
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
let country = 'Finland'
let city = 'Helsinki'
let language = 'JavaScript'
let job = 'teacher'
let quote = "The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020."
let quotWithBackTick = `The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020.`
```

### String Concatenation

Connecting two or more strings together is called concatenation. Using the strings declared in the previous String section:

```
let fullName = firstName + space + lastName; // concatenation, merging two string together.
console.log(fullName);

```

### Concatenating Using Addition Operator

Concatenating using the addition operator is an old way. This way of concatenating is tedious and error-prone. It is good to know how to concatenate this way, but I strongly suggest to use the ES6 template strings (explained later on).

```
// Declaring different variables of different data types
let space = ' '
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
let country = 'Finland'
let city = 'Helsinki'
let language = 'JavaScript'
let job = 'teacher'
let age = 250

let fullName =firstName + space + lastName
let personInfoOne = fullName + '. I am ' + age + '. I live in ' + country; // ES5 string addition

console.log(personInfoOne)
```

```
Asabeneh Yetayeh. I am 250. I live in Finland
```

### Long Literal Strings

A string could be a single character or paragraph or a page. If the string length is too big it does not fit in one line. We can use the backslash character (\) at the end of each line to indicate that the string will continue on the next line. **Example:**

```
const paragraph = "My name is Asabeneh Yetayeh. I live in Finland, Helsinki.\
I am a teacher and I love teaching. I teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, \
Node.js, Python, Data Analysis and D3.js for anyone who is interested to learn. \
In the end of 2019, I was thinking to expand my teaching and to reach \
to global audience and I started a Python challenge from November 20 - December 19.\
It was one of the most rewarding and inspiring experience.\
Now, we are in 2020. I am enjoying preparing the 30DaysOfJavaScript challenge and \
I hope you are enjoying too."

console.log(paragraph)
```

### Escape Sequences in Strings

In JavaScript and other programming languages \ followed by some characters is an escape sequence. Let's see the most common escape characters:

- \n: new line
- \t: Tab, means 8 spaces
- \\: Back slash
- \': Single quote (')
- \": Double quote (")

```
console.log('I hope everyone is enjoying the 30 Days Of JavaScript challenge.\nDo you ?') // line break
console.log('Days\tTopics\tExercises')
console.log('Day 1\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 2\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 3\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 4\t3\t5')
console.log('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') // To write a backslash
console.log('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"')
console.log("In every programming language it starts with \'Hello, World!\'")
console.log('The saying \'Seeing is Believing\' isn\'t correct in 2020')
```

Output in console:

```
I hope everyone is enjoying the 30 Days Of JavaScript challenge.
Do you ?
Days  Topics  Exercises
Day 1 3 5
Day 2 3 5
Day 3 3 5
Day 4 3 5
This is a backslash  symbol (\)
In every programming language it starts with "Hello, World!"
In every programming language it starts with 'Hello, World!'
The saying 'Seeing is Believing' isn't correct in 2020
```

### Template Literals (Template Strings)

To create a template strings, we use two back-ticks. We can inject data as expressions inside a template string. To inject data, we enclose the expression with a curly bracket({}) preceded by a $ sign. See the syntax below.

```
//Syntax
`String literal text`
`String literal text ${expression}`
```

**Example: 1**

`console.log(`The sum of 2 and 3 is 5`)              // statically writing the data
let a = 2
let b = 3
console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}`) // injecting the data dynamically`

### String Methods

Everything in JavaScript is an object. A string is a primitive data type that means we can not modify it once it is created. The string object has many string methods. There are different string methods that can help us to work with strings.

1. *length*: The string *length* method returns the number of characters in a string included empty space.

**Example:**

```
let js = 'JavaScript'
console.log(js.length)         // 10
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
console.log(firstName.length)  // 8
```

1. *Accessing characters in a string*: We can access each character in a string using its index. In programming, counting starts from 0. The first index of the string is zero, and the last index is the length of the string minus one.

let string = 'JavaScript'
let firstLetter = string[0]

console.log(firstLetter)           // J

let secondLetter = string[1]       // a
let thirdLetter = string[2]
let lastLetter = string[9]

console.log(lastLetter)            // t

let lastIndex = string.length - 1

console.log(lastIndex)  // 9
console.log(string[lastIndex])    // t

1. *toUpperCase()*: this method changes the string to uppercase letters.

```
let string = 'JavaScript'

console.log(string.toUpperCase())     // JAVASCRIPT

let firstName = 'Asabeneh'

console.log(firstName.toUpperCase())  // ASABENEH

let country = 'Finland'

console.log(country.toUpperCase())    // FINLAND
```

1. *toLowerCase()*: this method changes the string to lowercase letters.

```
let string = 'JavasCript'

console.log(string.toLowerCase())     // javascript

let firstName = 'Asabeneh'

console.log(firstName.toLowerCase())  // asabeneh

let country = 'Finland'

console.log(country.toLowerCase())   // finland
```

1. *substr()*: It takes two arguments, the starting index and number of characters to slice.

```
let string = 'JavaScript'
console.log(string.substr(4,6))    // Script

let country = 'Finland'
console.log(country.substr(3, 4))   // land
```

1. *substring()*: It takes two arguments, the starting index and the stopping index but it doesn't include the character at the stopping index.

```
let string = 'JavaScript'

console.log(string.substring(0,4))     // Java
console.log(string.substring(4,10))    // Script
console.log(string.substring(4))       // Script

let country = 'Finland'

console.log(country.substring(0, 3))   // Fin
console.log(country.substring(3, 7))   // land
console.log(country.substring(3))      // land
```

1. *split()*: The split method splits a string at a specified place.

```
let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript'

console.log(string.split())     // Changes to an array -> ["30 Days Of JavaScript"]
console.log(string.split(' '))  // Split to an array at space -> ["30", "Days", "Of", "JavaScript"]

let firstName = 'Asabeneh'

console.log(firstName.split())    // Change to an array - > ["Asabeneh"]
console.log(firstName.split(''))  // Split to an array at each letter ->  ["A", "s", "a", "b", "e", "n", "e", "h"]

let countries = 'Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland'

console.log(countries.split(','))  // split to any array at comma -> ["Finland", " Sweden", " Norway", " Denmark", " and Iceland"]
console.log(countries.split(', ')) //  ["Finland", "Sweden", "Norway", "Denmark", "and Iceland"]
```

1. *trim()*: Removes trailing space in the beginning or the end of a string.

```
let string = '   30 Days Of JavaScript   '

console.log(string)
console.log(string.trim(' '))

let firstName = ' Asabeneh '

console.log(firstName)
console.log(firstName.trim())  // still removes spaces at the beginning and the end of the string
```

```
   30 Days Of JavasCript
30 Days Of JavasCript
  Asabeneh
Asabeneh
```

1. *includes()*: It takes a substring argument and it checks if substring argument exists in the string. *includes()* returns a boolean. If a substring exist in a string, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.

```
let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript'

console.log(string.includes('Days'))     // true
console.log(string.includes('days'))     // false - it is case sensitive!
console.log(string.includes('Script'))   // true
console.log(string.includes('script'))   // false
console.log(string.includes('java'))     // false
console.log(string.includes('Java'))     // true

let country = 'Finland'

console.log(country.includes('fin'))     // false
console.log(country.includes('Fin'))     // true
console.log(country.includes('land'))    // true
console.log(country.includes('Land'))    // false
```

1. *replace()*: takes as a parameter the old substring and a new substring.

```
string.replace(oldsubstring, newsubstring)
```

```
let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript'
console.log(string.replace('JavaScript', 'Python')) // 30 Days Of Python

let country = 'Finland'
console.log(country.replace('Fin', 'Noman'))       // Nomanland
```

1. *charAt()*: Takes index and it returns the value at that index

```
string.charAt(index)
```

```
let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript'
console.log(string.charAt(0))        // 3

let lastIndex = string.length - 1
console.log(string.charAt(lastIndex)) // t
```

1. *charCodeAt()*: Takes index and it returns char code (ASCII number) of the value at that index

```
string.charCodeAt(index)
```

```
let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript'
console.log(string.charCodeAt(3))        // D ASCII number is 68

let lastIndex = string.length - 1
console.log(string.charCodeAt(lastIndex)) // t ASCII is 116
```

1. *indexOf()*: Takes a substring and if the substring exists in a string it returns the first position of the substring if does not exist it returns -1

```
string.indexOf(substring)
```

```
let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript'

console.log(string.indexOf('D'))          // 3
console.log(string.indexOf('Days'))       // 3
console.log(string.indexOf('days'))       // -1
console.log(string.indexOf('a'))          // 4
console.log(string.indexOf('JavaScript')) // 11
console.log(string.indexOf('Script'))     //15
console.log(string.indexOf('script'))     // -1
```

1. *lastIndexOf()*: Takes a substring and if the substring exists in a string it returns the last position of the substring if it does not exist it returns -1

```
//syntax
string.lastIndexOf(substring)
```

```
let string = 'I love JavaScript. If you do not love JavaScript what else can you love.'

console.log(string.lastIndexOf('love'))       // 67
console.log(string.lastIndexOf('you'))        // 63
console.log(string.lastIndexOf('JavaScript')) // 38
```

1. *concat()*: it takes many substrings and joins them.

```
string.concat(substring, substring, substring)
```

```
let string = '30'
console.log(string.concat("Days", "Of", "JavaScript")) // 30DaysOfJavaScript

let country = 'Fin'
console.log(country.concat("land")) // Finland
```

1. *startsWith*: it takes a substring as an argument and it checks if the string starts with that specified substring. It returns a boolean(true or false).

```
//syntax
string.startsWith(substring)
```

```
let string = 'Love is the best to in this world'

console.log(string.startsWith('Love'))   // true
console.log(string.startsWith('love'))   // false
console.log(string.startsWith('world'))  // false

let country = 'Finland'

console.log(country.startsWith('Fin'))   // true
console.log(country.startsWith('fin'))   // false
console.log(country.startsWith('land'))  //  false
```

1. *endsWith*: it takes a substring as an argument and it checks if the string ends with that specified substring. It returns a boolean(true or false).

```
string.endsWith(substring)
```

```
let string = 'Love is the most powerful feeling in the world'

console.log(string.endsWith('world'))         // true
console.log(string.endsWith('love'))          // false
console.log(string.endsWith('in the world')) // true

let country = 'Finland'

console.log(country.endsWith('land'))         // true
console.log(country.endsWith('fin'))          // false
console.log(country.endsWith('Fin'))          //  false
```

1. *search*: it takes a substring as an argument and it returns the index of the first match. The search value can be a string or a regular expression pattern.

```
string.search(substring)
```

```
let string = 'I love JavaScript. If you do not love JavaScript what else can you love.'
console.log(string.search('love'))          // 2
console.log(string.search(/javascript/gi))  // 7
```

1. *match*: it takes a substring or regular expression pattern as an argument and it returns an array if there is match if not it returns null. Let us see how a regular expression pattern looks like. It starts with / sign and ends with / sign.

```
let string = 'love'
let patternOne = /love/     // with out any flag
let patternTwo = /love/gi   // g-means to search in the whole text, i - case insensitive
```

Match syntax

```
// syntax
string.match(substring)
```

```
let string = 'I love JavaScript. If you do not love JavaScript what else can you love.'
console.log(string.match('love'))
```

```
["love", index: 2, input: "I love JavaScript. If you do not love JavaScript what else can you love.", groups: undefined]
```

```
let pattern = /love/gi
console.log(string.match(pattern))   // ["love", "love", "love"]
```

Let us extract numbers from text using a regular expression. This is not the regular expression section, do not panic! We will cover regular expressions later on.

```
let txt = 'In 2019, I ran 30 Days of Python. Now, in 2020 I am super exited to start this challenge'
let regEx = /\d+/// d with escape character means d not a normal d instead acts a digit
// + means one or more digit numbers,
// if there is g after that it means global, search everywhere.

console.log(txt.match(regEx))  // ["2", "0", "1", "9", "3", "0", "2", "0", "2", "0"]
console.log(txt.match(/\d+/g)) // ["2019", "30", "2020"]
```

1. *repeat()*: it takes a number as argument and it returns the repeated version of the string.

```
string.repeat(n)
```

```
let string = 'love'
console.log(string.repeat(10)) // lovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelove
```

## Checking Data Types and Casting

### Checking Data Types

To check the data type of a certain variable we use the *typeof* method.

**Example:**

```
// Different javascript data types
// Let's declare different data types

let firstName = 'Asabeneh'      // string
let lastName = 'Yetayeh'        // string
let country = 'Finland'         // string
let city = 'Helsinki'           // string
let age = 250                   // number, it is not my real age, do not worry about it
let job                         // undefined, because a value was not assigned

console.log(typeof 'Asabeneh')  // string
console.log(typeof firstName)   // string
console.log(typeof 10)          // number
console.log(typeof 3.14)        // number
console.log(typeof true)        // boolean
console.log(typeof false)       // boolean
console.log(typeof NaN)         // number
console.log(typeof job)         // undefined
console.log(typeof undefined)   // undefined
console.log(typeof null)        // object
```

### Changing Data Type (Casting)

- Casting: Converting one data type to another data type. We use *parseInt()*, *parseFloat()*, *Number()*, *+ sign*, *str()* When we do arithmetic operations string numbers should be first converted to integer or float if not it returns an error.

### String to Int

We can convert string number to a number. Any number inside a quote is a string number. An example of a string number: '10', '5', etc. We can convert string to number using the following methods:

- parseInt()
- Number()
- Plus sign(+)

```
let num = '10'
let numInt = parseInt(num)
console.log(numInt) // 10
```

```
let num = '10'
let numInt = Number(num)

console.log(numInt) // 10
```

```
let num = '10'
let numInt = +num

console.log(numInt) // 10
```

### String to Float

We can convert string float number to a float number. Any float number inside a quote is a string float number. An example of a string float number: '9.81', '3.14', '1.44', etc. We can convert string float to number using the following methods:

- parseFloat()
- Number()
- Plus sign(+)

```
let num = '9.81'
let numFloat = parseFloat(num)

console.log(numFloat) // 9.81
```

```
let num = '9.81'
let numFloat = Number(num)

console.log(numFloat) // 9.81
```

```
let num = '9.81'
let numFloat = +num

console.log(numFloat) // 9.81
```

### Float to Int

We can convert float numbers to integers. We use the following method to convert float to int:

- parseInt()

`let num = 9.81
let numInt = parseInt(num)

console.log(numInt) // 9`

## Booleans

A boolean data type represents one of the two values:*true* or *false*. Boolean value is either true or false. The use of these data types will be clear when you start the comparison operator. Any comparisons return a boolean value which is either true or false.

**Example: Boolean Values**

`let isLightOn = true
let isRaining = false
let isHungry = false
let isMarried = true
let truValue = 4 > 3    // true
let falseValue = 4 < 3  // false`

### Truthy values

- All numbers(positive and negative) are truthy except zero
- All strings are truthy except an empty string ('')
- The boolean true

### Falsy values

- 0
- 0n
- null
- undefined
- NaN
- the boolean false
- '', "", ``, empty string

## Undefined

If we declare a variable and if we do not assign a value, the value will be undefined. In addition to this, if a function is not returning the value, it will be undefined.

```
let firstName
console.log(firstName) //not defined, because it is not assigned to a value yet
```

## Null

```
let empty = null
console.log(empty) // -> null , means no value
```

## Operators

### Assignment operators

An equal sign in JavaScript is an assignment operator. It uses to assign a variable.

`let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let country = 'Finland'`

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are mathematical operators.

- Addition(+): a + b
- Subtraction(-): a - b
- Multiplication(*): a * b
- Division(/): a / b
- Modulus(%): a % b
- Exponential(**): a ** b

```
let numOne = 4
let numTwo = 3
let sum = numOne + numTwo
let diff = numOne - numTwo
let mult = numOne * numTwo
let div = numOne / numTwo
let remainder = numOne % numTwo
let powerOf = numOne ** numTwo

console.log(sum, diff, mult, div, remainder, powerOf) // 7,1,12,1.33,1, 64
```

```
const PI = 3.14
let radius = 100          // length in meter

//Let us calculate area of a circle
const areaOfCircle = PI * radius * radius
console.log(areaOfCircle)  //  314 m

const gravity = 9.81      // in m/s2
let mass = 72             // in Kilogram

// Let us calculate weight of an object
const weight = mass * gravity
console.log(weight)        // 706.32 N(Newton)

const boilingPoint = 100  // temperature in oC, boiling point of water
const bodyTemp = 37       // body temperature in oC

// Concatenating string with numbers using string interpolation
/*
 The boiling point of water is 100 oC.
 Human body temperature is 37 oC.
 The gravity of earth is 9.81 m/s2.
 */
console.log(
  `The boiling point of water is ${boilingPoint} oC.\nHuman body temperature is ${bodyTemp} oC.\nThe gravity of earth is ${gravity} m / s2.`
)
```

### Comparison Operators

In programming we compare values, we use comparison operators to compare two values. We check if a value is greater or less or equal to other value.

### Logical Operators

The following symbols are the common logical operators: &&(ampersand) , ||(pipe) and !(negation). The && operator gets true only if the two operands are true. The || operator gets true either of the operand is true. The ! operator negates true to false and false to true.

```
// && ampersand operator example

const check = 4 > 3 && 10 > 5         // true && true -> true
const check = 4 > 3 && 10 < 5         // true && false -> false
const check = 4 < 3 && 10 < 5         // false && false -> false

// || pipe or operator, example

const check = 4 > 3 || 10 > 5         // true  || true -> true
const check = 4 > 3 || 10 < 5         // true  || false -> true
const check = 4 < 3 || 10 < 5         // false || false -> false

//! Negation examples

let check = 4 > 3                     // true
let check = !(4 > 3)                  //  false
let isLightOn = true
let isLightOff = !isLightOn           // false
let isMarried = !false                // true
```

### Increment Operator

In JavaScript we use the increment operator to increase a value stored in a variable. The increment could be pre or post increment. Let us see each of them:

1. Pre-increment

```
let count = 0
console.log(++count)        // 1
console.log(count)          // 1
```

1. Post-increment

`let count = 0
console.log(count++)        // 0
console.log(count)          // 1`

### Decrement Operator

In JavaScript we use the decrement operator to decrease a value stored in a variable. The decrement could be pre or post decrement. Let us see each of them:

1. Pre-decrement

```
let count = 0
console.log(--count) // -1
console.log(count)  // -1
```

1. Post-decrement

```
let count = 0
console.log(count--) // 0
console.log(count)   // -1
```

### Ternary Operators

Ternary operator allows to write a condition. Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. Look at the following examples:

```
let isRaining = true
isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
isRaining = false

isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
```

```
You need a rain coat.
No need for a rain coat.
```

```
let number = 5
number > 0
  ? console.log(`${number} is a positive number`)
  : console.log(`${number} is a negative number`)
number = -5

number > 0
  ? console.log(`${number} is a positive number`)
  : console.log(`${number} is a negative number`)
```

```
5 is a positive number
-5 is a negative number
```

### 

# Operator precedence

**Operator precedence** determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence.

## Window Methods

### Window alert() method

As you have seen at very beginning alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. It is a builtin method and it takes on argument.

```
alert(message)
```

```
alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')
```

Do not use too much alert because it is destructing and annoying, use it just to test.

### Window prompt() method

The window prompt methods display a prompt box with an input on your browser to take input values and the input data can be stored in a variable. The prompt() method takes two arguments. The second argument is optional.

```
prompt('required text', 'optional text')
```

```
let number = prompt('Enter number', 'number goes here')
console.log(number)
```

### Window confirm() method

The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a specified message, along with an OK and a Cancel button. A confirm box is often used to ask permission from a user to execute something. Window confirm() takes a string as an argument. Clicking the OK yields true value, whereas clicking the Cancel button yields false value.

```
const agree = confirm('Are you sure you like to delete? ')
console.log(agree) // result will be true or false based on what you click on the dialog box
```

These are not all the window methods we will have a separate section to go deep into window methods.

## Date Object

Time is an important thing. We like to know the time a certain activity or event. In JavaScript current time and date is created using JavaScript Date Object. The object we create using Date object provides many methods to work with date and time.The methods we use to get date and time information from a date object values are started with a word *get* because it provide the information. *getFullYear(), getMonth(), getDate(), getDay(), getHours(), getMinutes, getSeconds(), getMilliseconds(), getTime(), getDay()*

### Creating a time object

Once we create time object. The time object will provide information about time. Let us create a time object

```
const now = new Date()
console.log(now) // Sat Jan 04 2020 00:56:41 GMT+0200 (Eastern European Standard Time)
```

We have created a time object and we can access any date time information from the object using the get methods we have mentioned on the table.

### Getting full year

Let's extract or get the full year from a time object.

```
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getFullYear()) // 2020
```

### Getting month

Let's extract or get the month from a time object.

```
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getMonth()) // 0, because the month is January,  month(0-11)
```

### Getting date

Let's extract or get the date of the month from a time object.

```
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getDate()) // 4, because the day of the month is 4th,  day(1-31)
```

### Getting day

Let's extract or get the day of the week from a time object.

```
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getDay()) // 6, because the day is Saturday which is the 7th day
//  Sunday is 0, Monday is 1 and Saturday is 6
// Getting the weekday as a number (0-6)
```

### Getting hours

Let's extract or get the hours from a time object.

```
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getHours()) // 0, because the time is 00:56:41
```

### Getting minutes

Let's extract or get the minutes from a time object.

```
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getMinutes()) // 56, because the time is 00:56:41
```

### Getting seconds

Let's extract or get the seconds from a time object.

```
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getSeconds()) // 41, because the time is 00:56:41
```

### Getting time

This method give time in milliseconds starting from January 1, 1970. It is also know as Unix time. We can get the unix time in two ways:

1. Using *getTime()*

```
const now = new Date() //
console.log(now.getTime()) // 1578092201341, this is the number of seconds passed from January 1, 1970 to January 4, 2020 00:56:41
```

1. Using *Date.now()*

```
const allSeconds = Date.now() //
console.log(allSeconds) // 1578092201341, this is the number of seconds passed from January 1, 1970 to January 4, 2020 00:56:41

const timeInSeconds = new Date().getTime()
console.log(allSeconds == timeInSeconds) // true
```

Let us format these values to a human readable time format. **Example:**

```
const now = new Date()
const year = now.getFullYear() // return year
const month = now.getMonth() + 1 // return month(0 - 11)
const date = now.getDate() // return date (1 - 31)
const hours = now.getHours() // return number (0 - 23)
const minutes = now.getMinutes() // return number (0 -59)

console.log(`${date}/${month}/${year} ${hours}:${minutes}`) // 4/1/2020 0:56
```

## Conditionals

Conditional statements are used for make decisions based on different conditions. By default , statements in JavaScript script executed sequentially from top to bottom. If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two ways:

- Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true
- Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true. In this section, we will cover *if*, *else* , *else if* statements. The comparison and logical operators we learned in the previous sections will be useful in here.

Conditions can be implementing using the following ways:

- if
- if else
- if else if else
- switch
- ternary operator

### If

In JavaScript and other programming languages the key word *if* is to used check if a condition is true and to execute the block code. To create an if condition, we need *if* keyword, condition inside a parenthesis and block of code inside a curly bracket({}).

```
// syntax
if (condition) {
  //this part of code runs for truthy condition
}
```

**Example:**

```
let num = 3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
}
//  3 is a positive number
```

As you can see in the condition example above, 3 is greater than 0, so it is a positive number. The condition was true and the block of code was executed. However, if the condition is false, we won't see any results.

```
let isRaining = true
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('Remember to take your rain coat.')
}
```

The same goes for the second condition, if isRaining is false the if block will not be executed and we do not see any output. In order to see the result of a falsy condition, we should have another block, which is going to be *else*.

### If Else

If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will be executed.

```
// syntax
if (condition) {
  // this part of code runs for truthy condition
} else {
  // this part of code runs for false condition
}
```

```
let num = 3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
} else {
  console.log(`${num} is a negative number`)
}
//  3 is a positive number

num = -3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
} else {
  console.log(`${num} is a negative number`)
}
//  -3 is a negative number
```

```
let isRaining = true
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
}
// You need a rain coat.

isRaining = false
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
}
// No need for a rain coat.
```

The last condition is false, therefore the else block was executed. What if we have more than two conditions? In that case, we would use *else if* conditions.

### If Else if Else

On our daily life, we make decisions on daily basis. We make decisions not by checking one or two conditions instead we make decisions based on multiple conditions. As similar to our daily life, programming is also full of conditions. We use *else if* when we have multiple conditions.

```
// syntax
if (condition) {
     // code
} else if (condition) {
   // code
} else {
    //  code

}
```

**Example:**

```
let a = 0
if (a > 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is a positive number`)
} else if (a < 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is a negative number`)
} else if (a == 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is zero`)
} else {
  console.log(`${a} is not a number`)
}
```

```
// if else if else
let weather = 'sunny'
if (weather === 'rainy') {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else if (weather === 'cloudy') {
  console.log('It might be cold, you need a jacket.')
} else if (weather === 'sunny') {
  console.log('Go out freely.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for rain coat.')
}
```

### Switch

Switch is an alternative for **if else if else else**. The switch statement starts with a *switch* keyword followed by a parenthesis and code block. Inside the code block we will have different cases. Case block runs if the value in the switch statement parenthesis matches with the case value. The break statement is to terminate execution so the code execution does not go down after the condition is satisfied. The default block runs if all the cases don't satisfy the condition.

```
switch(caseValue){
  case 1:
    // code
    break
  case 2:
   // code
   break
  case 3:
   // code
   break
  default:
   // code
}
```

```
let weather = 'cloudy'
switch (weather) {
  case 'rainy':
    console.log('You need a rain coat.')
    break
  case 'cloudy':
    console.log('It might be cold, you need a jacket.')
    break
  case 'sunny':
    console.log('Go out freely.')
    break
  default:
    console.log(' No need for rain coat.')
}

// Switch More Examples
let dayUserInput = prompt('What day is today ?')
let day = dayUserInput.toLowerCase()

switch (day) {
  case 'monday':
    console.log('Today is Monday')
    break
  case 'tuesday':
    console.log('Today is Tuesday')
    break
  case 'wednesday':
    console.log('Today is Wednesday')
    break
  case 'thursday':
    console.log('Today is Thursday')
    break
  case 'friday':
    console.log('Today is Friday')
    break
  case 'saturday':
    console.log('Today is Saturday')
    break
  case 'sunday':
    console.log('Today is Sunday')
    break
  default:
    console.log('It is not a week day.')
}
```

// Examples to use conditions in the cases

```
let num = prompt('Enter number');
switch (true) {
  case num > 0:
    console.log('Number is positive');
    break;
  case num == 0:
    console.log('Numbers is zero');
    break;
  case num < 0:
    console.log('Number is negative');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Entered value was not a number');
}
```

### Ternary Operators

Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. We have covered this in other sections, but we should also mention it here.

`let isRaining = true
isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')`

## Arrays

In contrast to variables, an array can store *multiple values*. Each value in an array has an *index*, and each index has *a reference in a memory address*. Each value can be accessed by using their *indexes*. The index of an array starts from *zero*, and the index of the last element is less by one from the length of the array.

An array is a collection of different data types which are ordered and changeable(modifiable). An array allows storing duplicate elements and different data types. An array can be empty, or it may have different data type values.

### How to create an empty array

In JavaScript, we can create an array in different ways. Let us see different ways to create an array. It is very common to use *const* instead of *let* to declare an array variable. If you ar using const it means you do not use that variable name again.

- Using Array constructor

```
// syntax
const arr = Array()
// or
// let arr = new Array()
console.log(arr) // []
```

- Using square brackets([])

```
// syntax
// This the most recommended way to create an empty list
const arr = []
console.log(arr)
```

### How to create an array with values

Array with initial values. We use *length* property to find the length of an array.

```
const numbers = [0, 3.14, 9.81, 37, 98.6, 100] // array of numbers
const fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'] // array of strings, fruits
const vegetables = ['Tomato', 'Potato', 'Cabbage', 'Onion', 'Carrot'] // array of strings, vegetables
const animalProducts = ['milk', 'meat', 'butter', 'yoghurt'] // array of strings, products
const webTechs = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Redux', 'Node', 'MongDB'] // array of web technologies
const countries = ['Finland', 'Denmark', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Iceland'] // array of strings, countries

// Print the array and its length

console.log('Numbers:', numbers)
console.log('Number of numbers:', numbers.length)

console.log('Fruits:', fruits)
console.log('Number of fruits:', fruits.length)

console.log('Vegetables:', vegetables)
console.log('Number of vegetables:', vegetables.length)

console.log('Animal products:', animalProducts)
console.log('Number of animal products:', animalProducts.length)

console.log('Web technologies:', webTechs)
console.log('Number of web technologies:', webTechs.length)

console.log('Countries:', countries)
console.log('Number of countries:', countries.length)
```

```
Numbers: [0, 3.14, 9.81, 37, 98.6, 100]
Number of numbers: 6
Fruits: ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon']
Number of fruits: 4
Vegetables: ['Tomato', 'Potato', 'Cabbage', 'Onion', 'Carrot']
Number of vegetables: 5
Animal products: ['milk', 'meat', 'butter', 'yoghurt']
Number of animal products: 4
Web technologies: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Redux', 'Node', 'MongDB']

Number of countries: 5
```

- Array can have items of different data types

```
const arr = [
    'Asabeneh',
    250,
    true,
    { country: 'Finland', city: 'Helsinki' },
    { skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Python'] }
] // arr containing different data types
console.log(arr)
```

### Creating an array using split

As we have seen in the earlier section, we can split a string at different positions, and we can change to an array. Let us see the examples below.

```
let js = 'JavaScript'
const charsInJavaScript = js.split('')

console.log(charsInJavaScript) // ["J", "a", "v", "a", "S", "c", "r", "i", "p", "t"]

let companiesString = 'Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Oracle, Amazon'
const companies = companiesString.split(',')

console.log(companies) // ["Facebook", " Google", " Microsoft", " Apple", " IBM", " Oracle", " Amazon"]
let txt =
  'I love teaching and empowering people. I teach HTML, CSS, JS, React, Python.'
const words = txt.split(' ')

console.log(words)
// the text has special characters think how you can just get only the words
// ["I", "love", "teaching", "and", "empowering", "people.", "I", "teach", "HTML,", "CSS,", "JS,", "React,", "Python"]
```

### Accessing array items using index

We access each element in an array using their index. An array index starts from 0. The picture below clearly shows the index of each element in the array.

```
const fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon']
let firstFruit = fruits[0] // we are accessing the first item using its index

console.log(firstFruit) // banana

secondFruit = fruits[1]
console.log(secondFruit) // orange

let lastFruit = fruits[3]
console.log(lastFruit) // lemon
// Last index can be calculated as follows

let lastIndex = fruits.length - 1
lastFruit = fruits[lastIndex]

console.log(lastFruit)  // lemon
```

```
const numbers = [0, 3.14, 9.81, 37, 98.6, 100]  // set of numbers

console.log(numbers.length)  // => to know the size of the array, which is 6
console.log(numbers)         // -> [0, 3.14, 9.81, 37, 98.6, 100]
console.log(numbers[0])      //  -> 0
console.log(numbers[5])      //  -> 100

let lastIndex = numbers.length - 1;
console.log(numbers[lastIndex]) // -> 100
```

```
const webTechs = [
  'HTML',
  'CSS',
  'JavaScript',
  'React',
  'Redux',
  'Node',
  'MongoDB'
] // List of web technologies

console.log(webTechs)        // all the array items
console.log(webTechs.length) // => to know the size of the array, which is 7
console.log(webTechs[0])     //  -> HTML
console.log(webTechs[6])     //  -> MongoDB

let lastIndex = webTechs.length - 1
console.log(webTechs[lastIndex]) // -> MongoDB
```

```
const countries = [
  'Albania',
  'Bolivia',
  'Canada',
  'Denmark',
  'Ethiopia',
  'Finland',
  'Germany',
  'Hungary',
  'Ireland',
  'Japan',
  'Kenya'
] // List of countries

console.log(countries)      // -> all countries in array
console.log(countries[0])   //  -> Albania
console.log(countries[10])  //  -> Kenya

let lastIndex = countries.length - 1;
console.log(countries[lastIndex]) //  -> Kenya
```

```
const shoppingCart = [
  'Milk',
  'Mango',
  'Tomato',
  'Potato',
  'Avocado',
  'Meat',
  'Eggs',
  'Sugar'
] // List of food products

console.log(shoppingCart) // -> all shoppingCart in array
console.log(shoppingCart[0]) //  -> Milk
console.log(shoppingCart[7]) //  -> Sugar

let lastIndex = shoppingCart.length - 1;
console.log(shoppingCart[lastIndex]) //  -> Sugar
```

### Modifying array element

An array is mutable(modifiable). Once an array is created, we can modify the contents of the array elements.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers[0] = 10      // changing 1 at index 0 to 10
numbers[1] = 20      // changing  2 at index 1 to 20

console.log(numbers) // [10, 20, 3, 4, 5]

const countries = [
  'Albania',
  'Bolivia',
  'Canada',
  'Denmark',
  'Ethiopia',
  'Finland',
  'Germany',
  'Hungary',
  'Ireland',
  'Japan',
  'Kenya'
]

countries[0] = 'Afghanistan'  // Replacing Albania by Afghanistan
let lastIndex = countries.length - 1
countries[lastIndex] = 'Korea' // Replacing Kenya by Korea

console.log(countries)
```

```
["Afghanistan", "Bolivia", "Canada", "Denmark", "Ethiopia", "Finland", "Germany", "Hungary", "Ireland", "Japan", "Korea"]
```

### Methods to manipulate array

There are different methods to manipulate an array. These are some of the available methods to deal with arrays:*Array, length, concat, indexOf, slice, splice, join, toString, includes, lastIndexOf, isArray, fill, push, pop, shift, unshift*

### Array Constructor

Array:To create an array.

```
const arr = Array() // creates an an empty array
console.log(arr)

const eightEmptyValues = Array(8) // it creates eight empty values
console.log(eightEmptyValues) // [empty x 8]
```

### Creating static values with fill

fill: Fill all the array elements with a static value

```
const arr = Array() // creates an an empty array
console.log(arr)

const eightXvalues = Array(8).fill('X') // it creates eight element values filled with 'X'
console.log(eightXvalues) // ['X', 'X','X','X','X','X','X','X']

const eight0values = Array(8).fill(0) // it creates eight element values filled with '0'
console.log(eight0values) // [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

const four4values = Array(4).fill(4) // it creates 4 element values filled with '4'
console.log(four4values) // [4, 4, 4, 4]
```

### Concatenating array using concat

concat:To concatenate two arrays.

```
const firstList = [1, 2, 3]
const secondList = [4, 5, 6]
const thirdList = firstList.concat(secondList)

console.log(thirdList) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

```
const fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon']                 // array of fruits
const vegetables = ['Tomato', 'Potato', 'Cabbage', 'Onion', 'Carrot'] // array of vegetables
const fruitsAndVegetables = fruits.concat(vegetables)                 // concatenate the two arrays

console.log(fruitsAndVegetables)
```

```
["banana", "orange", "mango", "lemon", "Tomato", "Potato", "Cabbage", "Onion", "Carrot"]
```

### Getting array length

Length:To know the size of the array

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers.length) // -> 5 is the size of the array
```

### Getting index an element in arr array

indexOf:To check if an item exist in an array. If it exists it returns the index else it returns -1.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

console.log(numbers.indexOf(5)) // -> 4
console.log(numbers.indexOf(0)) // -> -1
console.log(numbers.indexOf(1)) // -> 0
console.log(numbers.indexOf(6)) // -> -1
```

Check an element if it exist in an array.

- Check items in a list

```
// let us check if a banana exist in the array

const fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon']
let index = fruits.indexOf('banana')  // 0

if(index === -1){
   console.log('This fruit does not exist in the array')
} else {
    console.log('This fruit does exist in the array')
}
// This fruit does exist in the array

// we can use also ternary here
index === -1 ? console.log('This fruit does not exist in the array'): console.log('This fruit does exist in the array')

// let us check if an avocado exist in the array
let indexOfAvocado = fruits.indexOf('avocado')  // -1, if the element not found index is -1
if(indexOfAvocado === -1){
   console.log('This fruit does not exist in the array')
} else {
    console.log('This fruit does exist in the array')
}
// This fruit does not exist in the array
```

### Getting last index of an element in array

lastIndexOf: It gives the position of the last item in the array. If it exist, it returns the index else it returns -1.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 1, 2]

console.log(numbers.lastIndexOf(2)) // 7
console.log(numbers.lastIndexOf(0)) // -1
console.log(numbers.lastIndexOf(1)) //  6
console.log(numbers.lastIndexOf(4)) //  3
console.log(numbers.lastIndexOf(6)) // -1
```

includes:To check if an item exist in an array. If it exist it returns the true else it returns false.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

console.log(numbers.includes(5)) // true
console.log(numbers.includes(0)) // false
console.log(numbers.includes(1)) // true
console.log(numbers.includes(6)) // false

const webTechs = [
  'HTML',
  'CSS',
  'JavaScript',
  'React',
  'Redux',
  'Node',
  'MongoDB'
] // List of web technologies

console.log(webTechs.includes('Node'))  // true
console.log(webTechs.includes('C'))     // false
```

### Checking array

Array.isArray:To check if the data type is an array

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(Array.isArray(numbers)) // true

const number = 100
console.log(Array.isArray(number)) // false
```

### Converting array to string

toString:Converts array to string

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers.toString()) // 1,2,3,4,5

const names = ['Asabeneh', 'Mathias', 'Elias', 'Brook']
console.log(names.toString()) // Asabeneh,Mathias,Elias,Brook
```

### Joining array elements

join: It is used to join the elements of the array, the argument we passed in the join method will be joined in the array and return as a string. By default, it joins with a comma, but we can pass different string parameter which can be joined between the items.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers.join()) // 1,2,3,4,5

const names = ['Asabeneh', 'Mathias', 'Elias', 'Brook']

console.log(names.join()) // Asabeneh,Mathias,Elias,Brook
console.log(names.join('')) //AsabenehMathiasEliasBrook
console.log(names.join(' ')) //Asabeneh Mathias Elias Brook
console.log(names.join(', ')) //Asabeneh, Mathias, Elias, Brook
console.log(names.join(' # ')) //Asabeneh # Mathias # Elias # Brook

const webTechs = [
  'HTML',
  'CSS',
  'JavaScript',
  'React',
  'Redux',
  'Node',
  'MongoDB'
] // List of web technologies

console.log(webTechs.join())       // "HTML,CSS,JavaScript,React,Redux,Node,MongoDB"
console.log(webTechs.join(' # '))  // "HTML # CSS # JavaScript # React # Redux # Node # MongoDB"
```

### Slice array elements

Slice: To cut out a multiple items in range. It takes two parameters:starting and ending position. It doesn't include the ending position.

```
  const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

  console.log(numbers.slice()) // -> it copies all  item
  console.log(numbers.slice(0)) // -> it copies all  item
  console.log(numbers.slice(0, numbers.length)) // it copies all  item
  console.log(numbers.slice(1,4)) // -> [2,3,4] // it doesn't include the ending position
```

### Splice method in array

Splice: It takes three parameters:Starting position, number of times to be removed and number of items to be added.

```
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  numbers.splice()
  console.log(numbers)                // -> remove all items
```

```
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	numbers.splice(0,1)
  console.log(numbers)            // remove the first item
```

```
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	numbers.splice(3, 3, 7, 8, 9)
  console.log(numbers.splice(3, 3, 7, 8, 9))  // -> [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9] //it removes three item and replace three items
```

### Adding item to an array using push

Push: adding item in the end. To add item to the end of an existing array we use the push method.

```
// syntax
const arr  = ['item1', 'item2','item3']
arr.push('new item')
console.log(arr)
// ['item1', 'item2','item3','new item']
```

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.push(6)
console.log(numbers) // -> [1,2,3,4,5,6]

numbers.pop() // -> remove one item from the end
console.log(numbers) // -> [1,2,3,4,5]
```

```
let fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon']
fruits.push('apple')
console.log(fruits)    // ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon', 'apple']

fruits.push('lime')
console.log(fruits)   // ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon', 'apple', 'lime']
```

### Removing the end element using pop

pop: Removing item in the end.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.pop() // -> remove one item from the end
console.log(numbers) // -> [1,2,3,4]
```

### Removing an element from the beginning

shift: Removing one array element in the beginning of the array.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.shift() // -> remove one item from the beginning
console.log(numbers) // -> [2,3,4,5]
```

### Add an element from the beginning

unshift: Adding array element in the beginning of the array.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.unshift(0) // -> add one item from the beginning
console.log(numbers) // -> [0,1,2,3,4,5]
```

### Reversing array order

reverse: reverse the order of an array.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.reverse() // -> reverse array order
console.log(numbers) // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

numbers.reverse()
console.log(numbers) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Sorting elements in array

sort: arrange array elements in ascending order. Sort takes a call back function, we will see how we use sort with a call back function in the coming sections.

```
const webTechs = [
  'HTML',
  'CSS',
  'JavaScript',
  'React',
  'Redux',
  'Node',
  'MongoDB'
]

webTechs.sort()
console.log(webTechs) // ["CSS", "HTML", "JavaScript", "MongoDB", "Node", "React", "Redux"]

webTechs.reverse() // after sorting we can reverse it
console.log(webTechs) // ["Redux", "React", "Node", "MongoDB", "JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"]
```

### Array of arrays

Array can store different data types including an array itself. Let us create an array of arrays

`const firstNums = [1, 2, 3]
const secondNums = [1, 4, 9]

const arrayOfArray =  [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
console.log(arrayOfArray[0]) // [1, 2, 3]

 const frontEnd = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Redux']
 const backEnd = ['Node','Express', 'MongoDB']
 const fullStack = [frontEnd, backEnd]
 console.log(fullStack)   // [["HTML", "CSS", "JS", "React", "Redux"], ["Node", "Express", "MongoDB"]]
 console.log(fullStack.length)  // 2
 console.log(fullStack[0])  // ["HTML", "CSS", "JS", "React", "Redux"]
 console.log(fullStack[1]) // ["Node", "Express", "MongoDB"]`

## Loops

Most of the activities we do in life are full of repetitions. Imagine if I ask you to print out from 0 to 100 using console.log(). To implement this simple task it may take you 2 to 5 minutes, such kind of tedious and repetitive task can be carried out using loop. If you prefer watching the videos, you can checkout the [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM4xOopkYiPwJqyKsSqL9mw)

In programming languages to carry out repetitive task we use different kinds of loops. The following examples are the commonly used loops in JavaScript and other programming languages.

### for Loop

```
// For loop structure
for(initialization, condition, increment/decrement){
  // code goes here
}
```

```
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
```

```
for(let i = 5; i >= 0; i--){
  console.log(i)
}

// 5 4 3 2 1 0
```

```
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  console.log(`${i} * ${i} = ${i * i}`)
}
```

```
0 * 0 = 0
1 * 1 = 1
2 * 2 = 4
3 * 3 = 9
4 * 4 = 16
5 * 5 = 25
```

```
const countries = ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Iceland']
const newArr = []
for(let i = 0; i < countries.length; i++){
  newArr.push(countries[i].toUpperCase())
}

// ["FINLAND", "SWEDEN", "DENMARK", "NORWAY", "ICELAND"]
```

Adding all elements in the array

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let sum = 0
for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
  sum  = sum + numbers[i]  // can be shorten, sum += numbers[i]

}

console.log(sum)  // 15
```

Creating a new array based on the existing array

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const newArr = []
let sum = 0
for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
  newArr.push( numbers[i] ** 2)

}

console.log(newArr)  // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

```
const countries = ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark', 'Iceland']
const newArr = []
for(let i = 0; i < countries.length; i++){
  newArr.push(countries[i].toUpperCase())
}

console.log(newArr)  // ["FINLAND", "SWEDEN", "NORWAY", "DENMARK", "ICELAND"]
```

### while loop

```
let i = 0
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log(i)
  i++
}

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
```

### do while loop

```
let i = 0
do {
  console.log(i)
  i++
} while (i <= 5)

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
```

### for of loop

We use for of loop for arrays. It is very hand way to iterate through an array if we are not interested in the index of each element in the array.

```
for (const element of arr) {
  // code goes here
}
```

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for (const num of numbers) {
  console.log(num)
}

// 1 2 3 4 5

for (const num of numbers) {
  console.log(num * num)
}

// 1 4 9 16 25

// adding all the numbers in the array
let sum = 0
for (const num of numbers) {
  sum = sum + num
	// can be also shorten like this, sum += num
  // after this we will use the shorter synthax(+=, -=, *=, /= etc)
}
console.log(sum) // 15

const webTechs = [
  'HTML',
  'CSS',
  'JavaScript',
  'React',
  'Redux',
  'Node',
  'MongoDB'
]

for (const tech of webTechs) {
  console.log(tech.toUpperCase())
}

// HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT REACT NODE MONGODB

for (const tech of webTechs) {
  console.log(tech[0]) // get only the first letter of each element,  H C J R N M
}
```

```
const countries = ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark', 'Iceland']
const newArr = []
for(const country of countries){
  newArr.push(country.toUpperCase())
}

console.log(newArr)  // ["FINLAND", "SWEDEN", "NORWAY", "DENMARK", "ICELAND"]
```

### break

Break is used to interrupt a loop.

```
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    break
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2
```

The above code stops if 3 found in the iteration process.

### continue

We use the keyword *continue* to skip a certain iterations.

```
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    continue
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2 4 5
```

  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2 4 5
```

## Scope

Variable is the fundamental part in programming. We declare variable to store different data types. To declare a variable we use the key word *var*, *let* and *const*. A variable can be declared at different scope. In this section, we will see the scope variables, scope of variables when we use var or let. Variables scopes can be:

- Global
- Local

Variable can be declared globally or locally scope. We will see both global and local scope. Anything declared without let, var or const is scoped at global level.

Let us imagine that we have a scope.js file.

### Window Global Object

Without using console.log() open your browser and check, you will see the value of a and b if you write a or b on the browser. That means a and b are already available in the window.

```
//scope.js
a = 'JavaScript' // declaring a variable without let or const make it available in window object and this found anywhere
b = 10 // this is a global scope variable and found in the window object
function letsLearnScope() {
  console.log(a, b)
  if (true) {
    console.log(a, b)
  }
}
console.log(a, b) // accessible
```

### Global scope

A globally declared variable can be accessed every where in the same file. But the term global is relative. It can be global to the file or it can be global relative to some block of codes.

```
//scope.js
let a = 'JavaScript' // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file
let b = 10 // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file
function letsLearnScope() {
  console.log(a, b) // JavaScript 10, accessible
  if (true) {
    let a = 'Python'
    let b = 100
    console.log(a, b) // Python 100
  }
  console.log(a, b)
}
letsLearnScope()
console.log(a, b) // JavaScript 10, accessible
```

### Local scope

A variable declared as local can be accessed only in certain block code.

- Block Scope
- Function Scope

```
//scope.js
let a = 'JavaScript' // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file
let b = 10 // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file
// Function scope
function letsLearnScope() {
  console.log(a, b) // JavaScript 10, accessible
  let value = false
// block scope
  if (true) {
    // we can access from the function and outside the function but
    // variables declared inside the if will not be accessed outside the if block
    let a = 'Python'
    let b = 20
    let c = 30
    let d = 40
    value = !value
    console.log(a, b, c, value) // Python 20 30 true
  }
  // we can not access c because c's scope is only the if block
  console.log(a, b, value) // JavaScript 10 true
}
letsLearnScope()
console.log(a, b) // JavaScript 10, accessible
```

Now, you have an understanding of scope. A variable declared with *var* only scoped to function but variable declared with *let* or *const* is block scope(function block, if block, loop block, etc). Block in JavaScript is a code in between two curly brackets ({}).

```
//scope.js
function letsLearnScope() {
  var gravity = 9.81
  console.log(gravity)

}
// console.log(gravity), Uncaught ReferenceError: gravity is not defined

if (true){
  var gravity = 9.81
  console.log(gravity) // 9.81
}
console.log(gravity)  // 9.81

for(var i = 0; i < 3; i++){
  console.log(i) // 0, 1, 2
}
console.log(i) // 3
```

In ES6 and above there is *let* and *const*, so you will not suffer from the sneakiness of *var*. When we use *let* our variable is block scoped and it will not infect other parts of our code.

```
//scope.js
function letsLearnScope() {
  // you can use let or const, but gravity is constant I prefer to use const
  const gravity = 9.81
  console.log(gravity)

}
// console.log(gravity), Uncaught ReferenceError: gravity is not defined

if (true){
  const  gravity = 9.81
  console.log(gravity) // 9.81
}
// console.log(gravity), Uncaught ReferenceError: gravity is not defined

for(let i = 0; i < 3; i++){
  console.log(i) // 0, 1, 2
}
// console.log(i), Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined
```

The scope *let* and *const* are the same. The difference is only reassigning. We can not change or reassign the value of the `const` variable. I would strongly suggest you to use *let* and *const*, by using *let* and *const* you will write clean code and avoid hard to debug mistakes. As a rule of thumb, you can use *let* for any value which change, *const* for any constant value, and for an array, object, arrow function and function expression.

## 📔 Object

Everything can be an object and objects do have properties and properties have values, so an object is a key value pair. The order of the key is not reserved, or there is no order. To create an object literal, we use two curly brackets.

### Creating an empty object

An empty object

```
const person = {}
```

### Creating an objecting with values

Now, the person object has firstName, lastName, age, location, skills and isMarried properties. The value of properties or keys could be a string, number, boolean, an object, null, undefined or a function.

Let us see some examples of object. Each key has a value in the object.

```
const rectangle = {
  length: 20,
  width: 20
}
console.log(rectangle) // {length: 20, width: 20}

const person = {
  firstName: 'Asabeneh',
  lastName: 'Yetayeh',
  age: 250,
  country: 'Finland',
  city: 'Helsinki',
  skills: [
    'HTML',
    'CSS',
    'JavaScript',
    'React',
    'Node',
    'MongoDB',
    'Python',
    'D3.js'
  ],
  isMarried: true
}
console.log(person)
```

### Getting values from an object

We can access values of object using two methods:

- using . followed by key name if the key-name is a one word
- using square bracket and a quote

```
const person = {
  firstName: 'Asabeneh',
  lastName: 'Yetayeh',
  age: 250,
  country: 'Finland',
  city: 'Helsinki',
  skills: [
    'HTML',
    'CSS',
    'JavaScript',
    'React',
    'Node',
    'MongoDB',
    'Python',
    'D3.js'
  ],
  getFullName: function() {
    return `${this.firstName}${this.lastName}`
  },
  'phone number': '+3584545454545'
}

// accessing values using .
console.log(person.firstName)
console.log(person.lastName)
console.log(person.age)
console.log(person.location) // undefined

// value can be accessed using square bracket and key name
console.log(person['firstName'])
console.log(person['lastName'])
console.log(person['age'])
console.log(person['age'])
console.log(person['location']) // undefined

// for instance to access the phone number we only use the square bracket method
console.log(person['phone number'])
```

### Creating object methods

Now, the person object has getFullName properties. The getFullName is function inside the person object and we call it an object method. The *this* key word refers to the object itself. We can use the word *this* to access the values of different properties of the object. We can not use an arrow function as object method because the word this refers to the window inside an arrow function instead of the object itself. Example of object:

```
const person = {
  firstName: 'Asabeneh',
  lastName: 'Yetayeh',
  age: 250,
  country: 'Finland',
  city: 'Helsinki',
  skills: [
    'HTML',
    'CSS',
    'JavaScript',
    'React',
    'Node',
    'MongoDB',
    'Python',
    'D3.js'
  ],
  getFullName: function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
}

console.log(person.getFullName())
// Asabeneh Yetayeh
```

### Setting new key for an object

An object is a mutable data structure and we can modify the content of an object after it gets created.

Setting a new keys in an object

```
const person = {
  firstName: 'Asabeneh',
  lastName: 'Yetayeh',
  age: 250,
  country: 'Finland',
  city: 'Helsinki',
  skills: [
    'HTML',
    'CSS',
    'JavaScript',
    'React',
    'Node',
    'MongoDB',
    'Python',
    'D3.js'
  ],
  getFullName: function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
}
person.nationality = 'Ethiopian'
person.country = 'Finland'
person.title = 'teacher'
person.skills.push('Meteor')
person.skills.push('SasS')
person.isMarried = true

person.getPersonInfo = function() {
  let skillsWithoutLastSkill = this.skills
    .splice(0, this.skills.length - 1)
    .join(', ')
  let lastSkill = this.skills.splice(this.skills.length - 1)[0]

  let skills = `${skillsWithoutLastSkill}, and ${lastSkill}`
  let fullName = this.getFullName()
  let statement = `${fullName} is a ${this.title}.\nHe lives in ${this.country}.\nHe teaches ${skills}.`
  return statement
}
console.log(person)
console.log(person.getPersonInfo())
```

```
Asabeneh Yetayeh is a teacher.
He lives in Finland.
He teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, MongoDB, Python, D3.js, Meteor, and SasS.
```

### Object Methods

There are different methods to manipulate an object. Let us see some of the available methods.

*Object.assign*: To copy an object without modifying the original object

```
const person = {
  firstName: 'Asabeneh',
  age: 250,
  country: 'Finland',
  city:'Helsinki',
  skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS'],
  title: 'teacher',
  address: {
    street: 'Heitamienkatu 16',
    pobox: 2002,
    city: 'Helsinki'
  },
  getPersonInfo: function() {
    return `I am ${this.firstName} and I live in ${this.city}, ${this.country}. I am ${this.age}.`
  }
}

//Object methods: Object.assign, Object.keys, Object.values, Object.entries
//hasOwnProperty

const copyPerson = Object.assign({}, person)
console.log(copyPerson)
```

### Getting object keys using Object.keys()

*Object.keys*: To get the keys or properties of an object as an array

```
const keys = Object.keys(copyPerson)
console.log(keys) //['firstName', 'age', 'country','city', 'skills','title', 'address', 'getPersonInfo']
const address = Object.keys(copyPerson.address)
console.log(address) //['street', 'pobox', 'city']
```

### Getting object values using Object.values()

*Object.values*:To get values of an object as an array

```
const values = Object.values(copyPerson)
console.log(values)
```

### Getting object keys and values using Object.entries()

*Object.entries*:To get the keys and values in an array

```
const entries = Object.entries(copyPerson)
console.log(entries)
```

### Checking properties using hasOwnProperty()

*hasOwnProperty*: To check if a specific key or property exist in an object

`console.log(copyPerson.hasOwnProperty('name'))
console.log(copyPerson.hasOwnProperty('score'))`
